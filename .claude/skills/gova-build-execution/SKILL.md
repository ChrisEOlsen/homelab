# GOVA Build Execution

Execute the plan by dispatching a fresh implementer subagent per task, a task review (spec compliance + code quality) after each, and a broad whole-branch review at the end.

**Why subagents:** You delegate tasks to specialized agents with isolated context. By precisely crafting their instructions and context, you ensure they stay focused and succeed at their task. They should never inherit your session's context or history — you construct exactly what they need. This also preserves your own context for coordination work.

**Core principle:** Fresh subagent per task + task review (spec + quality) + broad final review = high quality, fast iteration

**Narration:** between tool calls, narrate at most one short line — the ledger and the tool results carry the record.

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause to check in with your human partner between tasks. Execute all tasks from the plan without stopping. The only reasons to stop are: BLOCKED status you cannot resolve, ambiguity that genuinely prevents progress, or all tasks complete. "Should I continue?" prompts and progress summaries waste their time — they asked you to execute the plan, so execute it.

**No worktree:** the branch was already created directly in the main checkout (`git checkout -b build/<app-name>`, no worktree — see CLAUDE.md § No Git Worktrees for Builds). Implementers verify by restarting the app, checking logs/behavior, and running `go test ./...` — scaffold-generated code has tests from its scaffold call; hand-customized logic gets a test per gova-writing-plans Step 3b.

## The Process

1. Read plan, note context and Global Constraints, create a todo per task
2. Per task:
   - Dispatch implementer subagent (`implementer-prompt.md`)
   - If it asks questions, answer them and re-dispatch
   - Implementer implements, verifies (restart + logs), commits, self-reviews
   - Write diff file (`scripts/review-package BASE HEAD`), dispatch task reviewer (`task-reviewer-prompt.md`)
   - If reviewer finds Critical/Important issues, dispatch a fix subagent, then re-review
   - Once spec ✅ and quality approved, mark task complete in todos and the progress ledger
3. Once all tasks are complete, invoke the `code-review` skill for a final whole-branch review of the full branch diff against the commit the branch started from
4. If the final review finds issues, dispatch one fix subagent with the complete findings list (not one fixer per finding), then hand control back to `/build` to continue to Step 6 (Security Analysis)

## Pre-Flight Plan Review

Before dispatching Task 1, scan the plan once for conflicts:

- tasks that contradict each other or the plan's Global Constraints
- anything the plan explicitly mandates that the review rubric treats as a defect (verbatim duplication of a logic block, a feature file written without its MCP scaffold call)

Present everything you find to your human partner as one batched question — each finding beside the plan text that mandates it, asking which governs — before execution begins, not one interrupt per discovery mid-plan. If the scan is clean, proceed without comment. The review loop remains the net for conflicts that only emerge from implementation.

## Model Selection

Use the least powerful model that can handle each role to conserve cost and increase speed.

**Mechanical implementation tasks** (one scaffold call, clear spec, 1-2 files to customize): use a fast, cheap model. Most implementation tasks in this stack are mechanical when the plan is well-specified.

**Integration and judgment tasks** (multi-file coordination, non-obvious customization): use a standard model.

**Architecture and design tasks**: use the most capable available model. The final whole-branch review is one of these — dispatch it on the most capable available model, not the session default.

**Review tasks**: choose the model with the same judgment, scaled to the diff's size, complexity, and risk. A small mechanical diff does not need the most capable model.

**Always specify the model explicitly when dispatching a subagent.** An omitted model inherits your session's model — often the most capable and most expensive — which silently defeats this section.

**Turn count beats token price.** Wall-clock and context cost scale with how many turns a subagent takes, and the cheapest models routinely take 2-3× the turns on multi-step work — costing more overall. Use a mid-tier model as the floor for reviewers and for implementers working from prose descriptions. When the task's plan text contains the complete MCP tool call and exact customization code, the implementation is transcription plus verification: use the cheapest tier for that implementer.

## Handling Implementer Status

Implementer subagents report one of four statuses. Handle each appropriately:

**DONE:** Generate the review package (`scripts/review-package BASE HEAD`, from this skill's directory — it prints the unique file path it wrote; BASE is the commit you recorded before dispatching the implementer — never `HEAD~1`, which silently drops all but the last commit of a multi-commit task), then dispatch the task reviewer with the printed path.

**DONE_WITH_CONCERNS:** The implementer completed the work but flagged doubts. Read the concerns before proceeding. If the concerns are about correctness or scope, address them before review. If they're observations (e.g., "this file is getting large"), note them and proceed to review.

**NEEDS_CONTEXT:** The implementer needs information that wasn't provided. Provide the missing context and re-dispatch.

**BLOCKED:** The implementer cannot complete the task. Assess the blocker:
1. If it's a context problem, provide more context and re-dispatch with the same model
2. If the task requires more reasoning, re-dispatch with a more capable model
3. If the task is too large, break it into smaller pieces
4. If the plan itself is wrong, escalate to the human

**Never** ignore an escalation or force the same model to retry without changes. If the implementer said it's stuck, something needs to change.

## Handling Reviewer ⚠️ Items

The task reviewer may report "⚠️ Cannot verify from diff" items — requirements that live in unchanged code or span tasks. These do not block the rest of the review, but you must resolve each one yourself before marking the task complete: you hold the plan and cross-task context the reviewer lacks. If you confirm an item is a real gap, treat it as a failed spec review — send it back to the implementer and re-review.

## Constructing Reviewer Prompts

Per-task reviews are task-scoped gates. The broad review happens once, at the final whole-branch review. When you fill a reviewer template:

- Do not add open-ended directives like "check all uses" without a concrete, task-specific reason
- Do not ask a reviewer to re-verify something the implementer already verified on the same code — the implementer's report carries the evidence
- Do not pre-judge findings for the reviewer — never instruct a reviewer to ignore or not flag a specific issue. If you believe a finding would be a false positive, let the reviewer raise it and adjudicate it in the review loop.
- The global-constraints block you hand the reviewer is its attention lens. Copy the binding requirements verbatim from the plan's Global Constraints section or the spec.
- Hand the reviewer its diff as a file: run this skill's `scripts/review-package BASE HEAD` and pass the reviewer the file path it prints. The output never enters your own context.
- A dispatch prompt describes one task, not the session's history. Do not paste accumulated prior-task summaries into later dispatches — a fresh subagent needs its task, the interfaces it touches, and the global constraints. Nothing else.
- Dispatch fix subagents for Critical and Important findings. Record Minor findings in the progress ledger as you go, and point the final whole-branch review at that list so it can triage which must be fixed before merge.
- A finding labeled plan-mandated — or any finding that conflicts with what the plan's text requires — is the human's decision: present the finding and the plan text, ask which governs.
- Every fix dispatch carries the implementer contract: the fix subagent re-verifies its change (restart + logs) and reports the results.
- If the final whole-branch review returns findings, dispatch ONE fix subagent with the complete findings list — not one fixer per finding.

## File Handoffs

Everything you paste into a dispatch prompt — and everything a subagent prints back — stays resident in your context for the rest of the session and is re-read on every later turn. Hand artifacts over as files:

- **Task brief:** before dispatching an implementer, run this skill's `scripts/task-brief PLAN_FILE N` — it extracts the task's full text to a uniquely named file and prints the path.
- **Report file:** name the implementer's report file after the brief (brief `…/task-N-brief.md` → report `…/task-N-report.md`) and put it in the dispatch prompt.
- **Reviewer inputs:** the task reviewer gets three paths — the same brief file, the report file, and the review package — plus the global constraints that bind the task.
- Fix dispatches append their fix report to the same report file and return a short summary; re-reviews read the updated file.

## Durable Progress

Conversation memory does not survive compaction. Track progress in a ledger file, not only in todos.

- At skill start, check for a ledger: `cat "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/.gova-build/progress.md"`. Tasks listed there as complete are DONE — do not re-dispatch them; resume at the first task not marked complete.
- When a task's review comes back clean, append one line to the ledger in the same message as your other bookkeeping: `Task N: complete (commits <base7>..<head7>, review clean)`.
- The ledger is your recovery map: the commits it names exist in git even when your context no longer remembers creating them. After compaction, trust the ledger and `git log` over your own recollection.
- `git clean -fdx` will destroy the ledger (it's git-ignored scratch); if that happens, recover from `git log`.

## Prompt Templates

- [implementer-prompt.md](implementer-prompt.md) - Dispatch implementer subagent
- [task-reviewer-prompt.md](task-reviewer-prompt.md) - Dispatch task reviewer subagent (spec compliance + code quality)
- Final whole-branch review: use the `code-review` skill

## Advantages

**vs. Manual execution:**
- Fresh context per task (no confusion)
- Parallel-safe review loop
- Subagent can ask questions (before AND during work)

**Efficiency gains:**
- Controller curates exactly what context is needed; bulk artifacts move as files, not pasted text
- Subagent gets complete information upfront
- Questions surfaced before work begins (not after)

**Quality gates:**
- Self-review catches issues before handoff
- Task review carries two verdicts: spec compliance and code quality
- Review loops ensure fixes actually work
- Spec compliance prevents over/under-building
- Code quality ensures the scaffolding rule and CLAUDE.md constraints held

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Start implementation on main without explicit user consent
- Skip task review, or accept a report missing either verdict (spec compliance AND task quality are both required)
- Proceed with unfixed issues
- Dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- Make a subagent read the whole plan file (hand it its task brief — `scripts/task-brief` — instead)
- Skip scene-setting context (subagent needs to understand where task fits)
- Ignore subagent questions (answer before letting them proceed)
- Accept "close enough" on spec compliance (reviewer found spec issues = not done)
- Skip review loops (reviewer found issues = implementer fixes = review again)
- Let implementer self-review replace actual review (both are needed)
- Tell a reviewer what not to flag, or pre-rate a finding's severity in the dispatch prompt
- Dispatch a task reviewer without a diff file — generate it first (`scripts/review-package BASE HEAD`)
- Move to next task while the review has open Critical/Important issues
- Re-dispatch a task the progress ledger already marks complete — check the ledger (and `git log`) after any compaction or resume

**If subagent asks questions:**
- Answer clearly and completely
- Provide additional context if needed
- Don't rush them into implementation

**If reviewer finds issues:**
- Implementer (same subagent) fixes them
- Reviewer reviews again
- Repeat until approved
- Don't skip the re-review

**If subagent fails task:**
- Dispatch fix subagent with specific instructions
- Don't try to fix manually (context pollution)
